0.22    2016-10-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Adjustment to test scripts under Windows (on Windows, Cwd::abs_path()
          needs path to actually exist).

0.20    2015-09-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.


0.19    2015-03-05  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Adjust to Riap 1.2.3 (remove support of "J" header), this admittedly
          makes the client cannot handle servers that use Riap 1.2.2 and
          earlier. So servers should also be upgraded.


0.18    2014-10-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add attribute: riap_version.


0.17    2014-10-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	  decoding of base64-encoded result).


0.16     2013-09-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Skip one riap+unix parse test on Windows due
           to error in abs_path() (relpath) if file does not exist. I'm trying
           to make Perinci::CmdLine work on Windows.


0.15     2013-09-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Replace URI with URI::Split.

0.12     2013-04-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Make Riap request 'uri' optional, you do not have to specify it in
           $server_url. This unclutters the $server_url.

         - Add helpers request_{tcp,unix,pipe}() methods for even cleaner server
           specification.

         - Add some tests for $server_url parsing.


0.11     2013-03-28  Released-By: SHARYANTO

0.04     2012-08-01  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Rename module from Perinci::Access::TCP::Client to
           Perinci::Access::Simple::Client, following the spec name change
           (Riap::TCP -> Riap::Simple). Now follows Riap 1.1.17.

         - Support accessing server via pipe (riap+pipe scheme).


0.03     2012-07-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fix: don't mix buffered and unbuffered I/O, use buffered (getline()
           is convenient)
